## Structure
As a group, we designed a multiple page design, plant website that focuses on the positive impact they have on mental health and wellbeing. We designated each member a page to build. This demonstates our learning of HTML CSS and Javascript on the code first girls "introduction to web-development" course.


## Included features
- :heart: HTML5 
- :orange_heart: CSS grid 
- :yellow_heart: CSS flex
- :green_heart: Form on registation page
- :blue_heart: Media queries 
- :purple_heart: Consistent nav bar throughout

## Improvements and futures ideas
- Continue to develop a working search bar - at the time our current experience of javascipt was not enough to finalise this however, we continue to learn and develop our experience to one day complete!
- As this was our first experience with github, we were not as familiar with using branches. In future, we would use branches to prevent the loss of work when merging.
- Fix broken links which did not upload with the last merge.
